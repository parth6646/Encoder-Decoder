Top Secret Encoder
Program Description:
This program will encrypt or decrypt any word that the user inputs by asking for a word and a key.
Data Dictionary: 
nums - char array with chars '1','2','0', and it is used for comparing to strings
original - char array with the alphabet in order
a - User input for user's decision in the main menu. I used a string to prevent input lengths greater than 1 and also to use a.charAt to compare validity
userIn - What the user inputs as their unencrypted word or encrpyted word
key - What the user inputs for the encrypting or decrypting key
newArr - char array name for new shifted array
b - string variable; is the option that they entered in the main menu
input - string variable; is the encrypting word / decrypting word / encrypting key / decrypting key in the method menuValid
count - counter to see if the user's input for encrypting/decrypting/encrypting key/decrypting key is only letters
z - Is the encrypting or decrypting key in the method shift
s - int variable to figure out how much to shift the original array by
shiftedOriginal - shifted Array in the method shiftedArray
i - used in for loops to count towards the sentinel value
j - used in for loops to count towards the sentinel value
shiftedArray - newArr in the method crptedName
end - The last letter in the alphabet that will be moved to the front of the array 
temp - temporary variable that changes and stores letters of the encrypted or decrypted word
userEncrypted - encrypted or decrypted word
